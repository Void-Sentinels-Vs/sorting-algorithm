        <p>Selection Algorithm</p>
        <p>A selection algorithm is used to find the kth smallest (or largest) element in a list or array. This element is known as the kth order statistic. Selection algorithms are essential for various tasks, such as finding the minimum, maximum, and median elements in a collection.

        <p>Radix Algorithm</p>
        <p>Radix Sort is a linear sorting algorithm that sorts elements by processing them digit by digit. It is particularly efficient for sorting integers or strings with fixed-size keys. Unlike comparison-based sorting algorithms, Radix Sort distributes elements into buckets based on each digit's value and sorts them by their significant digits, from the least significant to the most significant</p>
